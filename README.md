HOW TO RUN THE MODEL
### Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge

This repository contains code for a deep learning model designed to tackle the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to build a multi-headed model thatâ€™s capable of detecting different types of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate in online comments.

#### Getting Started

To run the deep learning model, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download the Dataset First, download the "jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge" dataset from Kaggle. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data).

2. Upload to Google Drive Upload the downloaded dataset to your Google Drive. This step is necessary for accessing the data in Colab or any other Google Colab environment.

3. Run the Cells: Once the dataset is uploaded, you can run the provided code cells in your preferred environment. Make sure to follow any additional instructions provided within the code.
4. At last we can see the loacl host for model which was deployed in gradio.
